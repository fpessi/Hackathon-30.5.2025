## Usage
This project is meant to be as a proof of concept / showcase for the AaltoAI Hackathon 2025.
The container for AI is only up until the end of the Hackathon! After this the AI side of the code will not work.
This project might be changed in the future to allow the use of own API key's etc, but there is no official roadmap for now.
